NHIT and Silicon Valley’s QubitDynamics unveiled a 5-year plan to establish the world’s first Arctic Quantum Data Center, leveraging NHIT’s subzero location for cryogenic qubit stability research. A joint master’s program will accompany the project.

NHIT Provost Dr. Ingrid Sørensen noted: "Natural Arctic cold slashes quantum cooling costs, embodying our ‘location-as-lab’ philosophy."

Student Benefit: Quantum computing majors gain priority access to internships starting Fall 2025.
