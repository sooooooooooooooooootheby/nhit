NHIT's undergraduate team Glacier Hack claimed gold at the ACM-ICPC Polar Finals, solving all problems in record timeâ€”marking the first victory by a university inside the Arctic Circle.

Team captain Alexei Petrov (Junior) credited their success to distributed algorithm optimization: _"NHIT's 'High-Latency Environment Computing' course (CS-407) was our secret weapon."_ The team will advance to the 2025 global finals.

Academic Link: The course Extreme Environment Computing is now dubbed a "competitive advantage" by students.
