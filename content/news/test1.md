The Artificial Intelligence and Embedded Systems Lab at North Harmon Institute of Technology (NHIT) has successfully developed FrostCore, a low-power AI chip designed for polar/extreme-cold environments. The chip remains stable at -40°C and triples energy efficiency in edge computing devices through its bio-inspired neural network architecture.

Lead researcher Dr. Elena Kovac stated: "FrostCore mimics Arctic animals' cold adaptation, with dynamic power regulation applicable to autonomous research vehicles and space exploration." The team has partnered with the Norwegian Polar Institute for field testing.
